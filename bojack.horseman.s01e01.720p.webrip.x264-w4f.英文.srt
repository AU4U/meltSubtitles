1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,550
Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,650
Mondays.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,820
Well, good morning to you too.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,370
Oh, hey.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,460
Where? I'd love hay.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,290
In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,780
premiered on ABC.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,190
The show, in which a young, bachelor horse

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,160
is forced to reevaluate his priorities

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,470
when he agrees to raise three human children,

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,440
was initially dismissed by critics

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,010
as broad and saccharine and not good,

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,680
but the family comedy struck a chord with America

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,730
and went on to air for nine seasons.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,900
The star of Horsin' Around, BoJack Horseman,

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,340
is our guest tonight.

18
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,450
Welcome, BoJack.

19
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,980
It is good to be here, Charlie.

20
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,350
Sorry I was late. The traffic...

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,850
It's really no problem.

23
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,800
I parked in a handicapped spot. I hope that's okay.

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,000
You parked in a...

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,360
I'm sorry, disabled spot.

26
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,850
Is that the proper nomenclature?

27
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,390
Maybe you should move the car.

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,830
No, I don't think I should drive right now.

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,430
I'm incredibly drunk.

30
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,580
You're telling me that you're drunk right now?

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,580
Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview?

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,940
I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.

33
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,330
Yes.

34
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,350
Anyway, we were talking about Horsin' Around.

35
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,710
To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal?

36
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,200
Charlie, listen, you know, I know that it's very hip these days

37
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,100
to shit all over Horsin' Around,

38
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,290
but at the time, I can tell you...

39
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,890
- Is it okay to say "Shit"? - Please don't.

40
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,820
'Cause I... I think the show's actually pretty solid for what it is.

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,270
It's not Ibsen, sure,

42
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,730
but look, for a lot of people,

43
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,500
life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra,

44
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,290
and sometimes when you get home

45
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,150
from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra,

46
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,340
you just want to watch a show about good, likable people

47
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,230
who love each other,

48
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,010
where, you know, no matter what happens,

49
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,560
at the end of 30 minutes,

50
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,670
everything's gonna turn out okay.

51
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,270
You know, because in real life...

52
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,600
Did I already say the thing about the urethra?

53
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,610
Well, let's talk about real life.

54
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,120
What have you been doing since the show's cancellation

55
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,330
18 years ago?

56
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,760
That's a great question, Charlie.

57
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,530
I, uh...

58
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,560
Uh, I...

60
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,410
Maury! Maury! Maury! Maury!

61
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,380
In the case of one-year-old Phoenix,

62
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,440
you are the father.

63
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,430
Morning, sunshine.

64
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,150
Why so gloomy, roomie?

65
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,810
First of all, we're not roommates. You are my houseguest.

66
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,990
Well, we don't need to put labels on things.

67
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,880
You sleep on my couch, and you don't pay rent.

68
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,330
I've had tapeworms that were less parasitic.

69
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,510
I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the first place.

70
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,960
Because my parents kicked me out,

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,840
and I had nowhere to go,

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,430
and even though you don't want anyone to know it...

73
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,560
you secretly have a good heart.

74
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,580
You told me they didn't approve of your "alternative lifestyle."

75
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,990
I thought you were, like, a troubled gay teen or something.

76
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,790
I didn't realize by "alternative lifestyle"

77
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,210
that you meant you were lazy.

78
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,590
That's on you for making assumptions.

79
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,730
Also, if you're looking for the Toaster Strudels,

80
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,780
I got really high last night and ate them all.

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,270
Did you say you've had tapeworms?

82
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,280
Thanks for meeting me here.

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,080
I would have invited you to my office,

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,410
but the electric company shut off our power.

86
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,470
That's unfortunate.

87
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,040
Just an issue with the bank and a lack of money in it.

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,590
Now, as you know, Penguin is very eager

89
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,740
to publish your memoirs,

90
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,950
but you keep missing your deadlines.

91
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,810
I know, and I'm sorry,

92
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,810
but I am making great progress.

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,200
BoJack Horseman - the BoJack Horseman Story,

94
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,390
written by BoJack Horseman.

95
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,180
Chapter One.

96
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,000
Chapter One.

97
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,200
Chapter...

98
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,730
One.

99
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,090
Look, we really need a bestseller here at Penguin.

100
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,930
Things are not that great for me, money wise.

101
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,040
Aren't you an editor at a major publishing house?

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,910
Yeah, a publishing house.

103
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,680
When was the last time you saw a book?

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,910
I thought I saw someone reading one in the park the other day,

105
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,700
but it turned out it was a takeout menu.

106
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,720
Whenever you're ready.

107
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,780
We're living month to month here.

108
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,410
We're kind of counting on your autobiography

109
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,950
to save the company, no pressure.

110
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,470
That's actually a lot of pressure.

111
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,530
Have you considered working with a ghostwriter?

112
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,110
Ugh, no, thank you.

113
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,620
Look, just give me one more week,

114
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,830
and I will give you some pages

115
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,150
that'll knock your ass back to the South Pole.

116
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,900
I'm from Cincinnati.

117
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,310
It... that doesn't matter.

118
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,940
I'll call you in a week.

119
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,130
Yes, one week.

120
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,970
I'm telling you, this book is a top priority for me.

123
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,180
Oh, right. Yeesh.

124
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,450
You're wearing that to the prom?

125
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,200
What, you don't think it's cute?

126
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,490
Neigh way, Jose.

127
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,490
"Neigh way, Jose."

128
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,870
I improvised that line.

129
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,580
I mean, it was written,

130
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,490
but I gave it the old BoJack spin.

131
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,260
Hey, how many times have you watched this episode?

132
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,360
Yeah, but do you get it, though?

133
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,550
Because "nay" means no,

134
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,420
but it's also a thing that horses say.

135
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,290
It works on every level.

136
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,340
- I get it. - Ah, you don't get it.

138
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,370
*Three little orphans one, two, three*

139
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,650
*Without a home or a family tree*

140
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,950
*Until this horse said "Live with me"*

141
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,850
*And now we've got a new family*

142
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,650
*We were lost and now we're found*

143
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,340
*Horsin' around*

144
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,600
Are you drunk?

145
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,250
Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds.

146
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,560
It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.

147
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,140
Yes.

148
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,540
Ah, yeah, I see.

149
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,400
You're just bummed out because Princess Carolyn

150
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,700
dumped you last night.

152
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,690
BoJack, we need to talk.

153
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,380
Hey, check out the rug on that guy.

154
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,290
Slow and steady, am I right, ladies?

155
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,600
Who does he think he's fooling?

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,040
Turtles don't have hair.

157
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,240
Stop embarrassing me.

158
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,900
That is Lenny Turteltaub.

159
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, I am not crazy about the bread here.

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,080
Why do I keep eating it?

161
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,950
BoJack, can you please just listen for a second?

162
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,090
You have my undivided attention.

163
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,160
I think we should see other people.

164
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Were we not seeing other people?

165
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,920
BoJack, I'm almost there.

166
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Wait. Shh! Shut up.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,380
Now, that's a horse of a different...

168
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,890
cruller?

169
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,730
God, that's good comedy.

170
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,150
- BoJack! - What?

171
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,710
Everyone gets a Mulligan,

172
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,080
and my Mulligan was Carey Mulligan.

173
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,730
I'm kidding, jeez. It was Emily Mortimer.

174
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,220
What is the problem here?

175
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,420
Are you embarrassed of me because I'm a has-been?

176
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,140
Because you know that I'm writing that book

177
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,160
that is gonna make everybody love me again.

178
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,150
You're not really writing a book.

179
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,500
Well, I already spent my advance,

180
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,610
so that's a first step.

181
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,200
Look, this has been a lot of fun,

182
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,020
but I need to start thinking about my future.

183
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,160
I mean, you don't even respect me enough to have a baby with me.

184
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,990
Whoa, what?

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,850
I never explicitly said that.

186
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,400
You said it with your actions.

187
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,640
What actions?

188
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,690
Oh, look at that baby.

189
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,780
Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw?

190
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,720
What? What? What? No, no, wha...

191
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,810
Step away from the stolen vehicle, sir!

192
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,610
No, no, no. Misunderstanding, officer.

193
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,160
I was running away from my girlfriend

194
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,300
whom I don't respect enough to have a baby with.

195
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,920
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?

196
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,640
Oh, face it. You're afraid of commitment.

197
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm not afraid of commitment.

198
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,660
I commit to things all the time.

199
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,410
It's the following through on that commitment that I take issue with.

200
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,180
Hey, stupid, isn't that your friend over there?

201
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,010
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter?

202
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,530
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

203
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,770
Is that BoJack Horseman?

204
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,150
Oh, jeez, here we go.

205
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,310
Mr. Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same room.

206
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,840
What is this, a crossover episode?

207
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,670
You know, that gets funnier every time.

208
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,720
You're being sarcastic,

209
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,040
but I think it does actually get funnier every time.

210
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,750
We're actually in the middle of breaking up right now,

211
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,050
- so if you could just... - Yeah?

212
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,810
- You're in the middle of it? - Yeah, that's right.

213
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,840
So would it be awkward if I joined you right now?

214
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,260
Yes, actually, it's very awkward.

215
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,980
Is that not clear?

216
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,810
Yeah, this is awkward right now?

217
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,430
Yes, please leave.

218
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,800
How are you, Mr. Peanutbutter?

219
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,510
Oh, living the dream, P.C., living the dream.

220
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,930
Why are you making conversation?

221
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,530
Oh, let's see, it's the English word.

222
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,400
It's called being polite, BoJack.

223
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,480
But am I crazy that this is a bad time?

224
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,420
Always a Clydesdale, never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

225
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,370
What?

226
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,790
You'll get that one later, man.

227
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,000
Erica, get out of here with that face.

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,260
Would it kill you to be civil?

229
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,640
This is why we're breaking up.

230
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,720
So it's not because of the thing with the baby?

231
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,670
It's because of a lot of things!

232
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,440
Waiter, could we please have the check? Thank you. 

233
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,630
We haven't even ordered yet.

234
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,660
I have wasted so many dinners on you, BoJack Horseman.

235
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,970
I don't know how you can expect anyone else to love you

236
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,380
when you so clearly hate yourself.

237
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,090
- Here you go. - Let me see that.

239
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,950
$10 for bread?

240
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,260
I don't want to live in a society

241
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,240
where the premeal bread isn't free.

242
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,150
It is free if you order a meal.

243
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,250
Can you take me home, please?

244
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,100
Yeah, but I didn't even eat that much bread.

245
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,220
What did I have? I must have had...

246
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,360
You ate nine baskets, sir.

247
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,820
Nine... really?

248
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,230
Great, now I'm gonna feel like a fat ass all week.

249
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,900
You've seen me naked. Do you think I'm getting chubby?

250
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,630
You want to know the real reason we're breaking up?

251
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,500
What was that? Sorry.

252
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,100
Couldn't hear you over the sound of my calories not metabolizing.

253
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
This is so classic you.

254
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,460
You're using this bread thing

255
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,560
to avoid talking about our relationship.

256
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,490
No, that is definitely not happening.

257
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,860
I'd like to go home now.

258
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,880
You think I'm fat.

259
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,750
So yeah, technically I was dumped,

260
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,500
but the real headline of the evening was,

261
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,230
"dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end."

262
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,700
What kind of headline is that?

263
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,590
Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago?

264
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,860
God damn it! Stop the presses.

265
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,440
You're not fat.

266
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,720
Oh, hey, let's throw a party. That'll cheer you up.

267
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,940
No, it won't. It'll cheer you up.

268
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,500
I'll stand in the corner by myself

269
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,230
eating cotton candy until I barf

270
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,770
like I did at your last party.

271
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,040
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?

272
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,480
That was a good party.

273
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,260
Hey, didn't we get a cotton candy machine for that party?

274
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,910
Who told you Princess Carolyn and I broke up?

275
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,480
- She did. - What?

276
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
You never took me home, jerk!

277
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Oh, everything's my fault.

278
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,720
Take me home.

279
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,590
Okay, jeez.

280
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,420
But I'm not looking for parking in Silver Lake.

281
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,590
I'll slow the car down to a crawl,

282
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,780
and you can duck and roll.

283
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,090
You know what, you can take a last look at this face,

284
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,840
because it's the last time you're gonna see it.

285
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,230
Hey-up!

286
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,080
Hello?

287
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,740
I've got Princess Carolyn for you.

288
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,260
Uh, okay.

289
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,480
BoJack.

290
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,170
Oh, my God, we just broke up.

291
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,790
Yeah, but I'm still your agent.

292
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,470
I pride myself on my ability

293
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,400
to separate my professional life from my personal life.

294
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,070
Great.

295
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,520
Then, as my agent, do you think I'm getting fat?

296
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,300
No way.

297
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,050
You are in the prime of your life, never looked better.

298
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,180
What about as my ex-girlfriend?

299
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,110
You look like a pile of crap ate a second pile of crap

300
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,860
and then crapped out a third pile of crap.

301
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,340
Wait, wait, so which pile of crap do I look like?

302
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,260
- The third one. - What? That's the worst one.

303
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm not calling you as your ex.

304
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,670
I'm calling you as your agent.

305
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,710
Remember that book you're pretending to write?

306
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,940
Well, Penguin wants an update on your progress.

307
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,270
Does Tuesday work for you,

308
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,550
or are you gonna be too busy this week

309
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,280
masturbating to old pictures of yourself?

310
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,300
I told you, that's not what was happening that time.

311
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,000
I was masturbating to what the picture represented.

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,110
You walked in at the worst possible moment!

313
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,990
So, Tuesday, though?

314
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,080
Yes, fine!

316
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,270
You don't have anything?

317
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,980
Hey, you got the electricity back. Good for you.

318
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,990
This company is in dire straits.

319
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,040
We made a series of very bad investments.

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,630
Ever hear of a young adult franchise

321
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,560
called the Swamp Monsters of Malibu?

322
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,590
Uh, no.

323
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,040
Then why did we spend $20 million on marketing?

324
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,740
It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.

325
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,390
Look, I know you're a busy guy.

326
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,670
Actually, I am a busy guy.

327
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,510
I live a very active lifestyle.

328
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,660
Can't I just stay home with you?

329
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,040
I know kindergarten is scary,

330
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,100
but you're a big girl now,

331
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,340
and you have to be brave.

332
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,900
Okay, Daddy.

333
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,940
Wait, did you just call me "Daddy"?

334
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,270
Little Sabrina grew up right before our eyes, right, Todd?

335
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,330
Todd?

336
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,900
Todd!

337
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,910
What?

338
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,090
Did Sabrina grow up before our eyes?

339
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,430
Yes!

340
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,910
We're tired of waiting.

341
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,720
We're hiring you a ghostwriter.

342
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,060
Diane Nguyen?

344
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,500
She's great, and she's got a thing for horses.

345
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,710
Check this out.

346
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,560
Hey, Secretariat.

348
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,050
You know, I always wanted to play Secretariat in a movie.

349
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,610
He's kind of my personal hero.

350
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,750
Could never get the project off the ground, though.

351
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,980
I mean, there was this one time I came close in the '90s,

352
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,940
but then those Prefontaine movies came out,

353
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,930
and people got tired of seeing running on-screen.

354
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,320
Don't tell me. Tell her!

355
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,370
She's cute.

356
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,940
Call her. That's a loan, by the way.

357
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,360
We can't afford to be giving out free books to people,

358
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,570
but you can take anything you want

359
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,630
from the Swamp Monsters swag box.

361
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,610
Oh, God, I'm a failure.

362
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,460
Oh, you're not a failure.

363
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,090
Why did I say I could write a book?

364
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,180
Because you have an amazing story to tell.

365
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,990
- Relax. - Relax?

366
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,420
Easy for you to say, you hippie.

367
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,390
You've never had a day of stress in your life.

368
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,980
Why?

369
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,550
And that's for trying to sell E on the cartel's turf.

370
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,810
Where's Gabriela?

371
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,780
She went back to Mexico City, ese,

372
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,800
to be with her husband.

373
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,400
What? No!

374
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,590
- Gabriela, why? - Who?

375
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,900
We were talking about me.

376
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,610
Can you try to focus for, like, a second?

377
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,340
Oh, yeah, sorry. You were saying?

378
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,150
Never should have signed this book deal.

379
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,220
You know what my problem is?

380
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,380
I can't say no to people

381
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,280
because I want everyone to like me.

382
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,760
You want everyone to like you?

383
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, why?

384
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,430
Do people not like me?

386
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,800
What were we talking about?

387
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,310
I can see the headline now,

388
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,440
"Stupid BoJack writes a stupid book about his stupid life,

389
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,610
nobody cares."

390
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,540
What newspapers are you reading?

391
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,940
Hey, why don't you just let that lady

392
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,540
write your book and be done with it?

393
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,360
Better question, why are you in my kitchen?

394
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,570
I'm making breakfast.

395
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,290
We had sex last night, dummy.

396
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,770
Ugh, I really got to start putting my phone

397
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,670
on airplane mode when I drink.

398
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,710
This lady probably thinks I'm just some dumb sitcom actor.

399
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,700
I hate her and her stupid,

400
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,750
impossible-to-pronounce last name.

401
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,830
You haven't even met her.

402
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,160
Give her a chance.

403
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,980
Oh, you should invite her to the party.

404
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,870
What party?

405
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,830
Why are you so obsessed

406
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,720
with throwing a party all of a sudden?

407
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,610
You know how much money we lost 'cause of you?

408
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,250
I can't even afford a hall now for my daughter's 15th birthday,

409
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,890
and now I got a hundred guests coming and nowhere to put them.

410
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,460
You owe me a party, cabrón, and if you don't deliver...

411
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,110
Because parties are fun?

412
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,420
This book is really important to me.

413
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,120
I don't want to just hand it off to some stranger.

414
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,110
If it's so important, why have you written

415
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,900
literally nothing in a year and a half?

416
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,210
It's too much pressure.

417
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,190
This book is my one shot at preserving my legacy.

418
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,310
I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good,

419
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,860
I'm gonna be a joke forever.

420
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Everyone thinks that I'm just this washed-up hack,

421
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,960
but actually...

422
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,890
Oh, God, actually, what if they're right?

423
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,200
I can't breathe.

424
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,110
Am I dying?

425
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,270
Toast. I smell burning toast!

426
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,810
Oh, my God, my toast!

427
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,220
Todd, on my grave,

428
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,610
I want it to say that I was born in 1975.

429
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,720
No one's gonna believe...

430
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,970
Damn it, can't you respect a dying man's wish?

431
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,850
You're not dying.

432
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,080
Well, we did everything we could.

433
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,260
Nurse, record the time of death.

434
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,750
It doesn't get easier.

435
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,940
It never gets easier.

437
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,920
What... I don't...

438
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,320
What do you mean he's dead?

439
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,910
That's right, sweetheart.

440
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,690
He died of a broken heart

441
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,750
because you didn't appreciate him enough,

442
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,920
and now he's gone forever.

443
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,140
We might have gone too dark on that series finale.

444
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,390
I'm required to hand you over

445
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,180
to the child protective services.

446
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,740
You're the state's problem now.

447
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,420
No!

448
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,690
Do you just take those DVDs with you everywhere you go?

449
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,850
Linus walked around with a blanket.

450
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,270
No one gave him shit for it.

451
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,690
How long is that doctor going to take?

452
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,670
I have a meeting with another client at 3:00.

453
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,570
You have other clients?

454
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,250
No, I make a living off you sitting on your ass all day.

455
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,760
Are your other clients more talented than I am?

456
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,650
Your silence speaks volumes.

457
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,560
*That was my intention*

458
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,700
Well, BoJack, it looks like what you experienced

459
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,590
was a mild anxiety attack.

460
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,590
Jesus, if that's mild,

461
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,990
I don't want to know what spicy feels like.

462
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,750
Too smart for the room?

463
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,210
It was a salsa joke, people.

464
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,730
You've been overstressed.

465
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,730
I need you to take it easy.

466
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,530
Take it easy, are you kidding?

467
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,930
He doesn't have a job. He has no real responsibilities.

468
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,000
He doesn't do anything but take it easy.

469
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,140
Well, can you take it even easier?

470
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,730
I can try, doctor. I can try.

471
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,890
This book deal is obviously stressing you out.

472
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,060
Will you just call the ghostwriter already?

473
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,010
What, you want me to call this woman on the phone?

475
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,550
Well, you just had another anxiety attack.

476
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,030
And Entertainment Weekly said I wasn't consistent.

477
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,710
Really, not even a pity laugh?

478
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,300
I did almost die.

479
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,290
I have to check on some other patients.

480
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,300
You have other patients?

481
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,680
BoJack, let's have a party, okay?

482
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,980
I'll organize the whole thing.

483
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,240
You can invite the ghostwriter

484
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,370
and have a nice, casual conversation

485
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,230
in a fun, pressure-free environment.

486
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,860
Okay, fine. We'll have a party.

487
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,260
Oh, thank God.

488
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,720
But we're not getting a cotton candy machine.

489
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,660
I can't control myself around those things.

490
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,480
I totally hear what you are saying,

491
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,220
and I will do my best.

492
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,910
Senor Horseman, I will never forget your generosity today.

493
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,860
You have made a powerful ally for life.

494
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,040
Let's dance!

495
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,540
Todd, who was that guy?

496
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,730
Who are all these people?

497
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,410
Oh, you know, just a variety of folks

498
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,870
from all walks of life.

499
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,040
Is this a quinceanera?

500
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,220
Oh, so any party with Mexican teenage girls

501
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,200
is a quinceanera?

502
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,710
Now who's racist?

504
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,000
I find that pinata offensive.

505
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,950
If you'll excuse me,

506
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,910
I have a Virgin of Guadalupe pendant to present.

507
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,420
BoJack!

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,570
Oh, good Lord.

509
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,650
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

510
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,480
Can you believe this, the two of us in the same house?

511
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,430
Is this a crossover episode?

512
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,800
No, I'm just kidding around, man.

513
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,990
Seriously, though, how are you?

514
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,190
Well, I've been kind of up and...

515
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,140
Living the dream, huh? Yeah.

516
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,860
Hey, we'll catch up later, all right?

517
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
I want to talk to you.

518
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,540
Erica, how are you looking so beautiful?

519
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,840
I'm furious.

520
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,240
Hey, BoJack, right?

521
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,200
- BoJack Horseman? - Yes.

522
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I don't want to mispronounce your name.

523
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,590
It's Diane.

524
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,280
Oh, Diane.

525
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,990
Thanks for inviting me to your party.

526
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,390
Sorry I haven't really been mingling.

527
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,550
I get kind of awkward at parties.

528
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,460
- Have you tried alcohol? - I don't know.

529
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,560
Parties make me anxious in a real broad sense.

530
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,120
Like, look at that guy.

531
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,320
He's having fun.

532
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,720
Why haven't I figured it out?

533
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,450
What guy?

534
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,870
No, there's no guy there.

535
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,310
I'm just saying, like, a guy, you know?

536
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,640
Oh, okay, yeah.

537
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,490
I'm probably just overthinking it

538
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,270
because I never got the practice

539
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,610
because I didn't get invited to any parties in high school.

540
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,350
What am I talking about?

541
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,280
You don't care about any of that.

542
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,260
Shut up, Diane.

543
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,710
You're at a party, compliment the host.

544
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,440
You have a lovely home.

545
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,260
Yeah, well, if you're gonna throw away

546
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,160
most of your adult life on some dumb sitcom,

547
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,470
you might as well get a sweet house out of the deal, right?

548
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,750
So what are you working on these days?

549
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,380
Well, mostly I just sit around the house

550
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,480
and complain about things.

551
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,260
Yeah, how's that working out for you?

552
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,210
I can't complain, so you know.

553
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,660
No, I will not have sex with you!

554
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,130
This girl wants me to have sex with her.

555
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,070
No, I'm just kidding around.

556
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,370
You're a good sport.

557
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,750
- Ugh, you know who that is? - Mr. Peanutbutter?

558
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,340
Yeah, he was on that show Mr. Peanutbutter's House

559
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,120
about that dog who adopted the three human kids.

560
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,510
What a dumb idea for a TV show.

561
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,130
You people are all right.

562
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,580
Who wants an autograph?

563
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,030
He's so stupid he doesn't realize

564
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,460
how miserable he should be. I envy that.

565
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,210
Hey, do you know the story of the dad from The Brady Bunch?

566
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,420
Do I know his story?

567
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,390
If I recall correctly,

568
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,880
he was bringing up three boys of his own.

569
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,470
Right, but...

570
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,080
They were four men living all together,

571
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,470
but they were all alone.

572
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,160
That is profoundly sad.

573
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,360
No, the story is that the guy who played the dad

574
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,650
hated being on The Brady Bunch because he was a real actor,

575
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,540
and he considered it beneath him.

576
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,450
Sound familiar?

577
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,180
That's not all that was beneath him.

578
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,840
Gay joke. Sorry, I'm better than that.

579
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
Most people don't even get to do

580
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,980
The Brady Bunch version

581
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,140
of the thing they want to do with their lives.

582
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,340
You're actually in a really good position now,

583
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,120
because you can pretty much do anything you want.

584
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,060
You're responsible for your own happiness, you know?

585
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,500
- Good Lord, that's depressing. - No, it's not.

586
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,950
I'm responsible for my own happiness?

587
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,390
I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast.

588
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,780
Todd!

589
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,350
I need help.

590
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,320
What would make you happy?

591
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,680
Well, finishing my memoir, I guess.

592
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,880
Is that all? I can help you with that.

593
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,190
Yeah? I mean, would you even want to?

594
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,620
You'd have to spend a lot of time with me.

595
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,580
You'd probably get sick of me.

596
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,520
I don't think that's going to happen.

597
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
- No? - No, BoJack.

598
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,850
Okay.

599
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,760
Well, then I guess you're hired,

600
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,250
but don't put all that stuff about how sad I am in the book.

601
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,610
Oh, that doesn't count.

602
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,830
We weren't on the clock yet.

603
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,150
Yeah, exactly.

604
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,720
You're only my ghostwriter starting nah...

605
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,310
- Starting now. - You got it.

606
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,650
- BoJack! - Ugh, this guy.

607
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,210
Hey, man, wanted to let you know,

608
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,640
you are out of beer.

609
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,480
Oh, I see you've met

610
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,710
my beautiful girlfriend, Diane Nguyen.

611
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

612
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,810
You drank all my beer?

613
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,670
- Also, you two are dating? - Yeah.

614
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,780
- You're dating him? - Yes.

615
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,820
This is your boyfriend?

616
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,050
- That is correct. - Uh-huh.

617
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,980
- You are going out with you? - Uh-huh.

618
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,760
But in a sexual way, not just as friends?

619
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,120
- That's right. - You have seen her naked.

620
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,030
Many times, yes.

621
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,800
- You are attracted to this? - Yes.

622
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,440
This penis has been inside this vagina.

623
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,730
- Yep. - But in a sexual way.

624
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,820
Oh, yes.

625
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,610
Oh, my God.

626
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,050
Are you okay?

627
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,050
I'm just...

628
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,660
I'm fine.

629
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,220
I'm just... I'm really happy for you.

630
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,580
Should we get someone, or...

631
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,840
No, everything's...

632
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,520
Oh, this is really...

633
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,350
Wonderful.

634
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,830
Oh, God.

635
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,610
Starting now.
